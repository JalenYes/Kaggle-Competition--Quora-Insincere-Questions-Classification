# Quora Tech challenge——Weeding out insincere questions

An existential problem for any major website today is how to handle toxic and divisive content. Quora wants to tackle this problem head-on to keep their platform a place where users can feel safe sharing their knowledge with the world.

Quora is a platform that empowers people to learn from each other. On Quora, people can ask questions and connect with others who contribute unique insights and quality answers. A key challenge is to weed out insincere questions -- those founded upon false premises, or that intend to make a statement rather than look for helpful answers.
